## Abstract

We have developed a type system for Ruby at Stripe with a goal of helping
developers understand code better, write code with more confidence, and
detect+prevent significant classes of bugs.

This talk shares experience of Stripe successfully adopting Sorbet in our
codebase which had millions lines of code that were written before the
typechecker had been conceived. The talk will describe:

- the process used to add typing to existing code;
- many tools developed to support this process;
- impact of this type system on safety and productivity at Stripe.

We also have some exciting announcements!

The talk does not require any previous knowledge of types and should be
accessible to a broad audience.
