title: Enabling Runtime Checks
---

As we've mentioned before, Sorbet is a [gradual](gradual.md) system: it can be
turned on and off at will. This means the predications `srb` makes statically
can be wrong.

That's why Sorbet also uses **runtime checks**: even if a static prediction was
wrong, it will get checked during runtime, making things fail loudly and
immediately, rather than silently and asynchronously.

In this doc we'll answer:

- What's the runtime effect of adding a `sig` to a method?
- Why do we want to have a runtime effect?
- What are our options if we don't want `sig`s to affect the runtime?


## Runtime-checked `sig`s

Adding a method signature opts that method into runtime typechecks (in addition
to opting it into [more static checks](static.md)). In this sense,
`sorbet-runtime` is similar to libraries for adding runtime contracts.

Concretely, adding a `sig` wraps the method defined beneath it in a new method
that:

- validates the types of arguments passed in against the types in the `sig`
- calls the original method
- validates the return type of the original method against what was declared
- returns what the original method returned

For example:

```ruby
require 'sorbet-runtime'

class Example
  extend T::Sig

  sig {params(x: Integer).returns(String)}
  def self.main(x)
    "Passed: #{x.to_s}"
  end
end

Example.main([]) # passing an Array!
```

```shell
‚ùØ ruby example.rb
...
Parameter 'x': Expected type Integer, got type Array with unprintable value (TypeError)
Caller: example.rb:11
Definition: example.rb:6
...
```

In this small example, we have a `main` method defined to take an Integer, but
we're passing an Array at the call site. When we run `ruby` on our example file,
sorbet-runtime raises an exception because the signature was violated.


## Why have runtime checks?

Runtime checks have been invaluable when developing Sorbet and rolling it out in
large Ruby codebases like Stripe's. Type annotations in a codebase are near
useless if developers don't trust them (consider how often YARD annotations fall
out of sync with the code... üò∞).

Adding a `sig` to a method is only as good as the predictions it lets `srb` make
about a codebase. Wrong sigs are actively harmful.

But, by leveraging runtime checks, we can gain lots of confidence in our type
annotations:

- Automated test runs become tests of our type annotations!
- Our production observability and monitoring catch bad sigs **early**, before
  they become entrenched in a codebase!

Most people are *either* familiar with a completely typed language (Java, Go,
etc.) or a completely untyped language like Ruby; a [gradual type
system](gradual.md) can be very foreign at first, including these runtime
checks. But it's precisely these runtime checks that make it easier to adopt
types in an existing codebase.


## Disabling runtime checks

Sometimes runtime checks don't make sense. For example, for particularly hot
method calls, we might not have the performance budget to `sig` a method. In
cases like these, it's possible to opt a single method out of runtime checks.

  checking in our code. Learn the available syntax advanced features of
