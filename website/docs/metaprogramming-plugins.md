In Ruby, it is possible to dynamically define methods. Consider the following
example:

```ruby
# metaprogramming.rb
# typed: true

class MetaProgramming
  def self.macro(name)
    define_method("#{name}_time") { name }
  end

  macro(:bed)
  macro(:fun)
end

hello = MetaProgramming.new
hello.bed_time # error: Method `bed_time` does not exist on MetaProgramming
hello.fun_time # error: Method `fun_time` does not exist on MetaProgramming
```

Sorbet rejects this script since Sorbet cannot understand
calls to `define_method` or other similar metaprogramming facilities.

Sorbet has a plugin system for handling metaprogramming patterns similar to the
one shown in this example. Specifically, we can write a plugin to teach Sorbet
what the method `macro` does.

Here is a plugin for `macro` in the example above:

```ruby
# macro_plugin.rb

# Sorbet calls this plugin with command line arguments similar to the following:
# --class MetaProgramming --method macro --source macro(:bed)
# we only care about the source here, so we use ARGV[5]
source = ARGV[5]
/macro\(:(.*)\)/.match(source) do |match_data|
  puts "def #{match_data[1]}_time; end"
end
```

We then use a YAML file to tell Sorbet about this plugin.

```yaml
# triggers.yaml

ruby_extra_args:
  # These options are forwarded to Ruby
  - '--disable-gems' # This option speeds up Ruby boot time. Use it if you don't need gems
triggers:
  macro: macro_plugin.rb # This tells Sorbet to run macro.rb when it sees a call to `macro`
```

Let's run Sorbet on our initial example again, this time with our new plugin
enabled:

```shell
❯ srb tc --dsl-plugins triggers.yaml metaprogramming.rb
No errors! Great job.
```

Sorbet executed our plugin and took into consideration its output. Method
definitions generated by our plugin fixed the error we saw initially.

## Debugging plugins

We can ask Sorbet to print out the output of all plugin calls using
`--print plugin-generated-code`:

```shell
❯ srb tc --print plugin-generated-code --dsl-plugins triggers.yaml metaprogramming.rb
# Path: "metaprogramming.rb//plugin-generated|0":
class MetaProgramming;
def bed_time; end
end;
# Path: "metaprogramming.rb//plugin-generated|1":
class MetaProgramming;
def fun_time; end
end;
No errors! Great job.
```

Anything printed to `$stderr` within a plugin will show up in the terminal when
`srb tc` runs.

## Caveats

- Sorbet decides which plugin to call using method names only. This might be a
  problem if different metaprogramming methods use the same name, have similar
  usages, but behave differently. To illustrate, using the configuration above,
  the following calls `macro_plugin.rb` twice but results in an error.

```ruby
class MetaProgramming
  def self.macro(name)
    define_method("#{name}_time") { name }
  end

  macro(:fun)
end

class DifferentMetaProgramming
  def self.macro(name)
    define_method(:different_macro) { name }
  end

  macro(:not_so_fun)
end

DifferentMetaProgramming.new.different_macro # error: Method `different_macro` does not exist
```

- The plugin system spawns many instances of Ruby and is very slow because of
  it.
- `--cache-dir` does not play well with the plugin system. On cached runs,
  Sorbet behaves as if there were no plugins specified.
