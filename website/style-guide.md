- always "the code", not "your code"

  - always "any problems", not "your problems"
  - prefer "we" to "you"
  - docs are a learning experience; no need to make it a matter of "Us vs Them"
  - script to lint for this

- naming conventions:

  - Sorbet (capital S, no monospace) → the whole project / team
    - sorbet (lowercase) is never allowed (unless talking specifically about the
      name of the binary that we ship with `sorbet-static`)
  - `srb` → _specifically_ the static system / command line
  - `sorbet-runtime` → _specifically_ the runtime system
  - `sig` or signature, never sig

- each doc should declare audience + main point in a comment

  - lint for this

- prettier

  - code blocks must have language, explicit plain for "no highlight"

- guides (i.e., non-reference pages) should end with a `What's next?` section
  with 2-4 links to suggested reading, relevant to reinforce what they just read
  about.
