# Sorbet logos

TODO(jez) Should we have usage guidelines for our logo? https://jira.corp.stripe.com/browse/CONTRACTS-5396

## Stickers

1.  Get an image for the logo that you'd like to print onto the sticker.

    In particular, our SVGs (exported from Sketch) have been known to render
    poorly with some sticker vendors. You might want to use a PNG instead.

2.  Choose a place to order from. The places we've ordered stickers from in the past:

    - <https://stickermule.comm> (recommended)

      Good quality, matte vinyl finish. Supports die cut.

    - <https://stickerapp.com>

      Good quality, gloss finish. Supports die cut.

3.  Choose a kind and size of sticker.

    - If going with die-cut, we usually go for the 2" x 2" square option. When
      cut, this will turn into about 1.9" x 1.5"
